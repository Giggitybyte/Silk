# Contributing

The issue tracker is only for bug reports and enhancement suggestions. If you have a question, please ask it in the [Discord server](https://discord.gg/qZPYmWUFY5) instead of opening an issue - you will be redirected there anyways.

To get ready to work on the codebase, please do the following:

1. Fork & clone the repository, and make sure you're on the `development` branch
